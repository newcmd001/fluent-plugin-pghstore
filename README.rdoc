= fluent-plugin-pghstore

== Component

=== PgHStoreOutput

Output to PostgreSQL hstore database. 

Output table should have tag, time and record column.:

  CREATE TABLE #{tablename} (
    tag TEXT[],
    time TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    record HSTORE
  );

A tag is splited by "." and stored in the TEXT[]. (Yes, postgres can handle an array!)

== Requirement

- PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher
  - hstore changed at PostgreSQL 9.0. 
- postgres-contrib
- ruby-pg

=== How to Install hstore

hstore is in the contrib. 

9.1 or higher:

  psql <dbname> -c "CREATE EXTENSION hstore;"

9.0:

  psql <dbname> -f ${PGHOME}/share/contrib/hstore.sql

== Configuration

Example:

  <match apache.*>
    type pghstore
    database test
    table test 
    table_option CREATE INDEX time_index ON testb (time);
  </match>

=== Options

- Required
  - database 
    - database name
- Optional
  - table
    - tablename. 
    - If not set, use +fluentd_store+. 
    - If not exists, creates automatically.
  - host
  - port
  - user
  - password
  - table_option 
    - Add some SQL. This SQL is called only once when table is created from this plugin.

== Limitation

- Nested output is not allowd.
- Since using only one connection, the performance may become bad. When you meet this, use connection pooling and write patch!
